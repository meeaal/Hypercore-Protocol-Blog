# Hypercore-Protocol-Blog

This is a simple decentralized collaborative markdown blog that is compatible with the Hypercore Protocol network.
We are using the mount function of hyperdrive to create a P2P file sharing system and showdown.js to convert markdown files into blog posts.

## View the blog

The easiest way to view the blog is using Beaker browser by visiting the following url: hyper://cab491db39be39c0542c611f60b12eabe689efbf2fd0210e280d73507137e0dd/

## post.txt structure

We are using text files to create a basic content management system.
Each user of the file sharing system has its own folder with post.txt file.
This file is fetched from the function.js file and used to fetch the blog posts.

The post.txt file uses following structure: Date, Catagory, Title, Link  

23-Aug-2021, Flowers, Flower seeds, user1/test.md  
24-Aug-2021, Flowers, Flower smells, user2/test.md  
25-Aug-2021, Tree, Tree leaves, user1/test2.md
